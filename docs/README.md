**Jenny** _the Generator_ are the set of tools developed at Typeform for rapid
development of production ready micro-services.

To get started you'll need [`Go`](https://golang.org/dl/) and that's pretty much
it. After you install `Go` go get `jenny` by;

```bash
go get github.com/jennyservices/jenny/cmd/jenny
```
